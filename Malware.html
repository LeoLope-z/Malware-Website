<h2>Cyber Sercurity</h2>
<p>Since the pandemic has started, there is no doubt that hackers have been taking advantage of their time and coming up with ways to pose cyber threats. These hackers are aiming at individuals who rely on technology. It is always important to have cyber security and safety rules for yourself when using your devices. For example, in this article it states that we need to be extra vigilant on verification. 
</p>

<p>Cyber Security is essential in order to prevent getting attacked by malware or by identity theft. For example in this article, it states that there is a huge threat--hackers are
 trying to get a hold of hospital dataw and use that data that they get for ransom. A threat being this big of a scale provides that the US is lacking in cyber security.</p>
