<h2>Cyber Security</h2>
  
<h4 style="font-size:18px;">What is Cyber Security?</h4>
<p>Cyber Security is the protection of the interent, hardware, and software data that a computer or any device has. It
protects against any cyberattacks from the client having this protection. <p>

  
  
  
<h4 style="font-size:18px;">How are individuals getting attacked?</h4>
<p>Since the pandemic has started, there is no doubt that hackers have been taking advantage of their time and coming up with ways to pose cyber threats. 
  These hackers are aiming at individuals who rely on technology. It is always important to have cyber security and safety rules for yourself when using your devices.
  By being safe online 
  We need to be extra vigilant on any types of verification.
</p>

<p>Cyber Security is essential in order to prevent getting attacked by malware or by identity theft. For example <a href=“https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/us/hospitals-cyberattacks-coronavirus.html”>this article.</a>, it states that there is a huge threat--hackers are
 trying to get a hold of hospital dataw and use that data that they get for ransom. A threat being this big of a scale provides that the US is lacking in cyber security.</p>

<p>With every passing day that covid continues to impact our daily lives, hackers get the advantage of the fear that people have towards covid. In a new way of hacking called emotet
malware. Emotet Malware is hackers sending spam mail to victims that will buy into the covid fear mongering and download the pdf for more instruction. By downloading this,
it will steal any of the user's sensitive informaton that they have. This cyber threat can be prevented by avoiding opening emails with any downloads.</p>

<h2>Social Engineering</h2>
<p>The term social engineering in the context of personal security information is the use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential or personal information that may be used for fraudulent purposes. Social engineering is a strategy cyber attackers use which involves tricking people into breaking standard security practices. When successful, many social engineering attacks enable attackers to gain legitimate unauthorized access to confidential information. Many of these tactics are used to gain full control of ones personal data information that may come in the form of an email containing a link or downloadable file. There are many ways a cyber attackers can do this.</p>

<p>There are four emotions social engineers exploit in order to gain access of personal information. Fear, Obedience, greed, and helpfulness are all emotions that can be manipulated by attackers. Fear is perhaps the most commonly used form to trick individuals to hand over personal information. Obedience stems from when attackers pose as authority figures usually sending out emails or phone calls in hopes of stealing information. Greed usually derives in the form of emails or phone calls where attackers send fake emails claiming the receiver has won x amount of money and all that is needed is a few personal information details in exchange. It is important to note that these four emotions are usually exploited to trick individuals but overall hacking of personal information is not limited by those factors.</p>

<p>As we move toward digital dependency many people will have to learn how to spot attempts of phishing attacks from cyber attackers. There are a few tips to help guide a user in identifying these attacks. The list goes, 1. Slow down. In terms of not clicking a link or downloading content without the proper research. 2. Research the facts pertaining to the email received and its contents. 3. Beware of any download. Do not instantaneously download videos. 4. Foreign offers are fake. Do not accept payments or offers they present.</p>
