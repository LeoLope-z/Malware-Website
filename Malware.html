<h2>Cyber Sercurity</h2>
<p>Since the pandemic has started, there is no doubt that hackers have been taking advantage of their time and coming up with ways to pose cyber threats. These hackers are aiming at individuals who rely on technology. It is always important to have cyber security and safety rules for yourself when using your devices. For example, in this article it states that we need to be extra vigilant on verification. 
</p>

<p>Cyber Security is essential in order to prevent getting attacked by malware or by identity theft. For example in this article, it states that there is a huge threat--hackers are
 trying to get a hold of hospital dataw and use that data that they get for ransom. A threat being this big of a scale provides that the US is lacking in cyber security.</p>

<p>With every passing day that covid continues to impact our daily lives, hackers get the advantage of the fear that people have towards covid. In a new way of hacking called emotet n
malware. Emotet Malware is hackers sending spam mail to victims that will buy into the covid fear mongering and download the pdf for more instruction. By downloading this,
it will steal any of the user's sensitive informaton that they have. This cyber threat can be prevented by avoiding opening emails with any downloads.</p>
  
  
<h2>Social Engineering</h2>
<p>The term social engineering in the context of information security is the use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential or personal information that may be used for fraudulent purposes. Social engineering is a strategy cyber attacker use which involves tricking people into breaking standard security practices. When successful, many social engineering attacks enable attackers to gain legitimate unauthorized access to confidential information. Many of these tactics to gain full control of ones personal data information may come in the form of an email containing a link or downloadable file. There are many ways a cyber attacker can do this

<p>There are four emotions social engineers exploit in order to gain access of personal information. Fear, Obedience, greed, and helpfulness are all emotions that can be manipulated by attackers. Fear is perhaps the most commonly used form to trick individuals to hand over personal information. Obedience stems from when attackers pose as authority figures usually sending out emails or phone calls in hopes of stealing information. Greed usually derives in the form of emails or phone calls where attackers send fake emails claiming the receiver has won x amount of money and all that is needed is a few personal information details in exchange. It is important to note that these four emotions are usually exploited to trick individuals but overall hacking of personal information is not limited by those factors. </p>

<p>Over time the term social engineering was given multiple meanings as it was first introduced as a sociological term pertaining to be understood as the influence social scientist had on society. To some extent scams can be referred as tactics of social engineering because ultimately the scammer is attempting to steal valuable information.
